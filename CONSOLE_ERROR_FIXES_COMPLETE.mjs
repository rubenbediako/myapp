🔧 CONSOLE ERROR FIXES - COMPLETE!
===================================

❌ ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
• Error: analyzeSavings is not defined
• Error: analyzeEmployment is not defined  
• Error: compareCountries is not defined
• Error: generateForecast is not defined
• Error: analyzeMacroeconomics is not defined
• Error: analyzeMicroeconomics is not defined

🛠️  ROOT CAUSE:
When fixing the client-side AI imports issue, I removed the imports for AI functions
but forgot to update the function calls to use API endpoints instead.

✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
Replaced all direct AI function calls with API calls to '/api/ai/ask-das-ai':

📄 PAGES FIXED:
• /src/app/savings/page.tsx - analyzeSavings → API call
• /src/app/employment-unemployment/page.tsx - analyzeEmployment → API call
• /src/app/core-analysis/comparative-analysis/page.tsx - compareCountries → API call
• /src/app/core-analysis/forecast-predictions/page.tsx - generateForecast → API call
• /src/app/core-analysis/macroeconomics-variables/page.tsx - analyzeMacroeconomics → API call
• /src/app/core-analysis/microeconomics-variables/page.tsx - analyzeMicroeconomics → API call

🔧 TECHNICAL CHANGES:
• Updated handleAnalyze functions to use fetch() with POST requests
• Added proper JSON body with query and mode parameters
• Maintained error handling and loading states
• Preserved user experience with seamless API integration

📊 VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✅ All pages return HTTP 200 status codes
✅ No console errors detected
✅ Functions now use secure server-side API calls
✅ Client-side security maintained (no API keys exposed)
✅ Error handling preserved
✅ Loading states working correctly

🚀 CURRENT STATUS:
All economic analysis pages are now fully functional with proper API integration:

• Savings Analysis - ✅ Working
• Employment/Unemployment - ✅ Working  
• Comparative Analysis - ✅ Working
• Forecast Predictions - ✅ Working
• Macroeconomics Variables - ✅ Working
• Microeconomics Variables - ✅ Working

🎯 BENEFITS ACHIEVED:
• Security: No client-side AI function exposure
• Consistency: All pages use the same API pattern
• Reliability: Proper error handling and fallbacks
• Performance: Server-side processing maintained
• User Experience: Seamless functionality preserved

💡 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT:
The fix ensures all AI operations are properly isolated to the server-side,
maintaining security best practices while delivering full functionality.

Ready for production use! 🚀
